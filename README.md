# Photo Editor
A photo editing app where you can upload images, apply different filters to modify them, and save a copy of it after you have finished editing.

This program uses `StdAudio.java` and `Picture.java` from Princeton University's [Java Standard Libraries](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).

## Usage
Make sure the image you want to upload has filetype extension *.jpg*, *.png*, *.gif*, *.tiff*, or *.bmp*.

To compile, type the command:
```
javac *.java
```
To run, type:
```
java Project
```
Once a valid image has been selected from the pop-up, the image should be displayed in a window on your screen. You will then be prompted to choose a filter to apply, with the options being blur, sharpen, invert, or black & white. You must type and enter the corresponding number for each option, answering any follow-up prompts if necessary. Once you are done, you may also select the option to save and exit. Remember to add the filtype extension when saving the file name.
